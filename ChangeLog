	* Makefile.am, demangle/Makefile.am: added base dependencies for
	the explicit compilation rules (not doing so could lead to a
	situation where the automatic dependency mechanism fails)

	* configure.in: additional checks for xfree and gcc
	
	* Makefile.in, configure, ...: removed generated files, as they
	don't belong to the CVS repository. Use autogen.sh to recreate
	them. (they are in the tarballs however).

	* README: updated the installation procedure
