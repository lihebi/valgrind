	* Makefile.am: added a bzdist target that creates a bzip2 archive
	of the project.

2002-03-24  Julian Seward  <sewardj@localhost.localdomain>

	* vg_to_ucode.c (disInstr): Implement DAA as well as DAS.
         Byrial Jensen <byrial@image.dk>

	 (dis_fpu_no_mem): Detect FPU instructions which set %EFLAGS and
	 mark the resulting UInstrs accordingly.

	* vg_errcontext.c (pp_ErrContext): Change message "Use of
	uninitialized CPU condition code" to "Conditional jump or move
	depends on uninitialised value(s)", since that will be more
	meaningful to most programmers.  Also change the suppression-kind
	to Cond in .supp files.  The old Value0 descriptor means the same
	and is still accepted.  Suggested by Joe Buck
	<Joe.Buck@synopsys.com>.

	* vg_syscall_mem.c: Add syscall setresgid32, from "Arkadi
	E. Shishlov" <arkadi@it.lv>

2002-03-22  Frédéric Gobry  <frederic.gobry@smartdata.ch>

	* Makefile.am, demangle/Makefile.am: added base dependencies for
	the explicit compilation rules (not doing so could lead to a
	situation where the automatic dependency mechanism fails)

	* configure.in: additional checks for xfree and gcc
	
	* Makefile.in, configure, ...: removed generated files, as they
	don't belong to the CVS repository. Use autogen.sh to recreate
	them. (they are in the tarballs however).

	* README: updated the installation procedure
