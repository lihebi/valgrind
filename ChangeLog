2002-03-24  Julian Seward  <sewardj@localhost.localdomain>

	* vg_syscall_mem.c: Add syscall setresgid32, from "Arkadi
	E. Shishlov" <arkadi@it.lv>

2002-03-22  Frédéric Gobry  <frederic.gobry@smartdata.ch>

	* Makefile.am, demangle/Makefile.am: added base dependencies for
	the explicit compilation rules (not doing so could lead to a
	situation where the automatic dependency mechanism fails)

	* configure.in: additional checks for xfree and gcc
	
	* Makefile.in, configure, ...: removed generated files, as they
	don't belong to the CVS repository. Use autogen.sh to recreate
	them. (they are in the tarballs however).

	* README: updated the installation procedure
