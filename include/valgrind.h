/* This file is for inclusion into client (your!) code.

   You can use these macros to manipulate and query memory permissions
   inside your own programs.

   The resulting executables will still run without Valgrind, just a
   little bit more slowly than they otherwise would, but otherwise
   unchanged.  

   When run on Valgrind with --client-perms=yes, Valgrind observes
   these macro calls and takes appropriate action.  When run on
   Valgrind with --client-perms=no (the default), Valgrind observes
   these macro calls but does not take any action as a result.  */



/* This defines the magic code sequence which the JITter spots and
   handles magically.  Don't look too closely at this; it will rot
   your brain.  Valgrind dumps the result value in %EDX, so we first
   copy the default value there, so that it is returned when not
   running on Valgrind.  Since %EAX points to a block of mem
   containing the args, you can pass as many args as you want like
   this.  Currently this is set up to deal with 4 args since that's
   the max that we appear to need (pthread_create).
